# Bacteria Infection Simulation in Python (Pygame)

This is a Python-based simulation of bacteria movement, food consumption, infection spread, recovery, and division. The simulation visualizes real-time interactions between healthy, infected, and immune bacteria using Pygame.

## Features

- Simulates infection spread between bacteria
- Bacteria recover and become immune with a configurable probability
- Food boosts health and triggers division if conditions are met
- Periodic infection events every 50 seconds
- Visual tracking of health, immunity, and death
- Smooth movement and realistic behavior

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pygame
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Math module

## How to Run

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pygame

Run the simulation:
python bacteria_simulation.py


## About This Project
This simulation was created to visualize concepts of:

- Cellular behavior
- Infection dynamics
- Food-based division
- Immunity and recovery

It helped me explore real-time updates, object interactions, and Pygame animation handling.
